# Campaign URLs - Short Source Parameters

This document lists the campaign URLs with shortened source parameters for tracking.

## URL Format

All campaign URLs use short codes for the `source` parameter to keep links concise.

## Campaign URLs

### Facebook

```
https://jiwarproperties.com/?source=f
```

### Instagram

```
https://jiwarproperties.com/?source=i
```

### Snapchat

```
https://jiwarproperties.com/?source=s
```

### TikTok

```
https://jiwarproperties.com/?source=t
```

## Source Parameter Mapping

The system automatically maps these short codes to full platform names for analytics:

| Short Code | Platform  |
| ---------- | --------- |
| `f`        | facebook  |
| `i`        | instagram |
| `s`        | snapchat  |
| `t`        | tiktok    |

## Notes

- The short codes are case-insensitive (both `F` and `f` will work)
- These URLs can be used on any page of the site (landing page, interest page, etc.)
- Analytics will automatically track and attribute traffic to the correct platform
- Unknown source codes will be stored as-is for future reference
